# reSync

An Android application to synchronize fanfiction.net and archiveofourown.com story (through links) to the reMarkable Cloud.


## Interesting Links

Because this is my first android application in a while (and my first one using kotlin, compose,
jetpack and all that new stuff) here is a compilation of links I found interesting to understand
what is going on (in no particular order).
