His day had been exhausting, as had every day of the past month. It wasn't the length of his day however, that was responsible for the aching of his muscles and the pounding of his head. That could only be attributed to grief, bone-deep, soul-consuming grief, a torment that, no matter how busy he had kept himself in the past month, had not left him for one moment.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>The newly refurbished Burrow was quiet, all his children sequestered in their respective bedrooms, he hoped sleeping peacefully. For some he knew sleep had been a struggle in the month since the Battle of Hogwarts. Others, Ron and Charlie among them, escaped into the mindless oblivion sleep provided. Arthur found himself to be a curious mixture of both. Sleep provided some relief from the ever-present anguish that had settled in his chest, though in his dreams he often found himself again in Hogwarts, this time, in his nightmares, surrounded by redheaded bodies. The memory of these dreams was enough to make him shudder and quicken his steps up the staircase.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Molly was a peacefully sleeping lump under the duvet and the sight of her face comfortably slackened with sleep soothed him instantly. She had struggled so bravely in the month since the battle and, despite his own pain, Arthur did not know when he had been prouder of her, or gladder that she was his wife.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>While Arthur had been needed at the Ministry in this important time of cleansing, Molly had held the Burrow and their children, together, much in the way she always had. They had both firmly adhered to the school of thought that suggested keeping busy was the key to keeping their grief from overwhelming them and so far this had worked rather well. Molly was in her element with a house full of adult children to fuss over, as well as the visits from those friends who continued to stop in regularly. Her days were so full of making sure that nobody wanted for anything that it seemed she could go for hours at a time without identifying the lump in her throat as grief, or the hole in her heart as belonging to their lost son.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Arthur spent his days alongside Kingsley, working within the Ministry to direct their resources to where they were most needed. He had turned down the promotion Kingsley had offered to him in the days immediately after the battle, though, in reality, the work he had occupied his last several weeks with was far from his usual. He longed for the days when the Ministry and world would settle in to a new beginning and he could go back to discovering the functions of inane Muggle objects.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Wearily donning his pajamas, Arthur sighed audibly as he slipped beneath the duvet. Molly turned to him, intertwining her fingers with his own.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>"I'm glad you're home," she told him in a voice that was barely audible even in the stillness of the night.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>"I'm glad to be home," he stroked his thumb over hers. "What's happened here today?"</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>"The usual," she sighed. "Charlie, George and Ron slept late. Harry, Ginny, Hermione and Percy were up early. Bill and Fleur stopped by after work, they'd spent the day fixing the damage Ron, Harry and Hermione left behind at Gringott's. Harry and Hermione were embarrassed, though I think Ron may have been a little proud. They told us what happened in the vaults," she shuddered and moved infinitesimally closer to her husband. "To think how many times we have come so close to losing them all."</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>They were both silent as they thought on how lucky they truly had been, despite the loss of Fred. That their son had been instrumental in bringing about the fall of the Dark Lord was still unbelievable, that he had survived was nothing short of a miracle. It was equally as miraculous that their youngest son's friends, who they had long since come to look at as their own, had also survived.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>"I think Percy was glad to be back at work," Arthur made an attempt to change the subject somewhat. "It did him good to be busy and to know that he still has a place in the Ministry."</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>"He always has been the most hard working of all the Weasley's," Molly sighed. "I worry though, that he's going back too soon. He seemed so tired this evening."</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>"We're all tired, dearest," Arthur reminded her gently. "It's part of it all, I think we'll all be tired for a long while yet."</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>"George wants to re-open the shop," she informed him. "I think it's a dreadful idea. It will just remind him of….his grief."</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>"I think we're all aware of our grief Molly," Arthur said soothingly. "If George wants to get back to work I don't think we can stop him. I think it might do him some good."</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>"You might be right," Molly sighed again. "I just wish we could keep them here forever, safe…"</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>"So do I, dearest," Arthur kissed her forehead, encouraging her to close her eyes. "So do I."</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>It was only a matter of moments before his weary body drifted off in to a fitful sleep.</em></strong></p><strong><em>\n<hr size="1" noshade="">\n<p>As Arthur fell in to an uneasy sleep, his third eldest son lay awake, staring at the ceiling above his bed. Percy Weasley was as exhausted as his father, sleep, however, would not come easily.</p><p>Like the rest of his family, Percy was wracked with grief from Fred's passing. For Percy however, the grief was almost outweighed by the guilt that had been his constant companion these few years. Even in his most pompous, Ministry-loving, self-important moments he had known, somewhere deep inside, that his actions against his family had been wrong. He had justified his actions, acknowledged the faults of his family and disregarded his own. Despite this justification, he had never been able to fully tune out or ignore the sense within him that his family, despite all their faults, was still his family, and deserved his loyalty.</p><p>Percy had often questioned the Sorting Hat's decision to place him in Gryffindor with his family. In his darkest moments of introspection he found little bravery, courage or loyalty within himself. He had reckoned, with his brains, he might have better suited to Ravenclaw, or, for all his hard work, Hufflepuff. To his eternal mortification and shame, he also found elements of those traits required to be placed in Slytherin house within himself and was prodigiously glad, if not a little bemused, that the Sorting Hat had seen something within him to see fit to place him with his family in Gryffindor.</p><p>Though he had perhaps not always best exemplified those traits attributable to Gryffindor's, he had come to believe that his actions in joining his family in time for the Battle of Hogwarts may have proven his worth as an alumni of that worthy House. He was heartily ashamed of himself for not acting sooner and relieved that his family had accepted his return so readily. That the brother he'd lost had been the first to welcome him back would forever be a painful reminder of his greatest folly.</p><p>It was thoughts of Fred that kept Percy awake at night so often. Memories, good and bad, danced through his head and kept him from finding his rest. Returning to the Ministry had only exacerbated his exhaustion, yet still, sleep would not come. Despite his insomnia, it felt good to be back at work, back doing what he had thought himself good at. That he was helping to destroy what he had assisted to build seemed ironic, but this time at least he was certain he was on the side of what was right.</p><p>Being back in his childhood bedroom offered a sense of comfort he had not anticipated on returning to the Burrow, despite his inability to sleep. As a child and an adolescent he had worked tirelessly to gain his parent's attention, his preferred method of doing so his achievements at school. His desperate need to be considered special had morphed him into an adult he had neither recognized nor liked, and now, having seen the error of his ways, he was constantly aware of his every action and thought, lest they betray a tendency for him to slip into his old habits.</p><p>As his thoughts dwelled on his past folly, suddenly, inexplicably his thoughts turned in a different direction. Even in the still of the night his face burnt with a fierce blush as unbidden, the image of Audrey Harrison, a witch that had come to work in the Ministry following the conclusion of the War, came to mind. They had met several days ago and he had worked closely with her that very day. He had found her to be an unassuming, kind woman, who reminded him strangely of both his mother and younger sister. She had quietly expressed her condolences for his loss and for the first time since Fred's death, after which he had been offered innumerable similar sentiments, Percy found himself sincerely appreciating her words. That she was pretty he could not deny, that he had been immediately drawn to her he could not explain.</p><p>Silently resolving to seek her out at the earliest opportunity, Percy finally found sleep, as dawn broke over the horizon.</p>\n<hr size="1" noshade="">\n<p>After months of living rough the luxury of a comfortable, warm bed was one Harry still relished. No matter how comfortable he was however, it was still impossible for him to sleep through the night. That he still woke at the quietest noise was no surprise. It was no easy thing to turn off his internal defense system that told him that danger was constantly lurking around the corner. A month after the Battle of Hogwarts his physical battle scars had long since faded with the tender ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and Mrs. Weasley. The scars littering his psyche would not be so quick to fade.</p><p>It was just after dawn and Ron's bedroom at the Burrow was slowly filling with sunlight. Only Ron's snores punctuating the stillness of the morning. Harry was wide awake, having woken some half an hour earlier drenched in sweat, his wand in hand. He was unable to remember his dreams, but his reaction to them told him they must be both vivid and terrifying. He couldn't remember the last time he had slept the whole night through, though in these days of quiet relaxation at the newly refurbished Burrow, it hardly mattered.</p><p>The days following the Battle had been in total juxtaposition to the indolent lifestyle he was currently attempting to enjoy. They had spent the first several days after the Battle at Hogwarts, where the very air around them was heavy with grief. A state of numbness had prevailed, as plans for the future had been made. Kingsley had offered Harry, Ron and Hermione their choice of positions within the ministry, hoping they would begin immediately, but Mrs. Weasley had put her foot down and insisted that they be allowed some time to recuperate before they were put to work. The wizarding world was in a state of upheaval and while they were eager to help, they were equally as eager to spend some time at rest. Kingsley had agreed; the trio would rest while the Ministry worked towards ensuring that all the Death Eaters and their sympathizers were captured. Once that had been done and the Ministry entered their rebuilding phase, Harry, Ron and Hermione would be put to work.</p><p>Harry was in regular contact with Kingsley and knew that the end was near. Following Voldemort's fall his surviving followers had scattered to the wind and finding them had become the top priority of the Ministry. A month on, their were few Death Eater's whose whereabouts were still unknown and Kingsley believed it was only a matter of time until they were found. Aware his days of relaxation were numbered, Harry strove to make the most of these days of nothingness, alongside the entire Weasley family. Though they all claimed to be recuperating and relaxing, the prevailing feel of the Burrow was one of grief. Harry was sure it would a long while yet before they could all come to terms with the sorrow buried deep within them all.</p><p>Giving up on sleep, Harry slipped from his bed, careful not to disturb Ron who continued to snore. He dressed quietly and made his way down the staircase that no longer creaked and groaned as it once had. He had been soundly walloped by Charlie in a game of wizard chess the night before and intended to review the game to pass the hours before everyone else would rise.</p><p>"Morning,"</p><p>Harry was just sitting down when a small voice from the entrance to the kitchen spoke. Startled, he drew his wand, lowering it immediately when his eyes found Ginny, still dressed in her pajamas, both hands clasped around a teacup.</p><p>"Sorry," he muttered, stowing his wand in his pocket. "Habit."</p><p>"Don't worry about it," she shrugged. "I cursed one of the chickens in the yard yesterday because it crowed too loudly and startled me. Moody would be proud."</p><p>Harry chuckled, but the sound was half-hearted at best.</p><p>"Couldn't sleep?" She enquired, ignoring the free lounge chairs she made for the empty space beside him.</p><p>"I've been up for a while," he told her as she settled on the couch. "You?"</p><p>"I can't remember the last time I slept properly," she refused to meet his eyes as she blew gently at the steam spiraling upwards from her cup. "Another habit I suppose."</p><p>"I know what you mean," Harry wasn't sure if it was sleep depravation or simple desperation, but the sight of her pursed lips cooling her tea suddenly made him very uncomfortable. Completely unbidden, the memory of the last time they had been alone together, many months prior, invaded his senses. It had been his birthday the year before and her gift had stayed with him in his memory ever since.</p><p>"I've missed you, Ginny." The words could no longer be suppressed.</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears that she hastily bit back, shifting infinitesimally closer to him on the couch.</p><p>"I missed you, Harry," she whispered. "So much, so, so much."</p><p>Hoping he was doing the right thing, he moved closer to her. Gently slipping an arm around her shoulders, he cuddled her close to him. With a sigh, she rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>They sat quietly together, content to simply be. Harry's heart, which for the past month had been consumed with the dead weight of grief, felt a little lighter, a little healthier, simply for being in her presence. As they sat in silence he hoped his nearness was providing a similar comfort to her.</p><p>"I wonder if life will ever go back to normal again," Ginny whispered eventually. "I've been lying awake at night wishing it would. But it never will, not without Fred and Tonks and Lupin. Not with everything we've gone through."</p><p>Harry wished he had an answer for her. He wasn't sure he had experienced 'normal' since he had first read his Hogwarts letter eight years previously. From that point he had spent his time evading, then chasing, the Dark Lord. A normal life, a life free from danger and precariousness, was something he wasn't sure how to lead.</p><p>"I guess we'll make a new normal," Harry suggested. "You're right, things will never go back to the ways they were, but you'll go back to Hogwarts soon, and I'll start work and life will keep going."</p><p>"And I'll miss you again."</p><p>"I'll miss you as well," he dared to brush a gentle kiss over her hair, reveling in the sweet smell he'd missed so much. "But you'll be done in a year and…."</p><p>"And...?"</p><p>"We'll start another new normal. I told you that dating you, the happiness being with you gave me, was like something out of someone else's life. I'd like for it to be my life, if you'll have me."</p><p>In response Ginny turned to Harry and pressed a fleeting kiss against his warm lips. With a content sigh, they reclined together on the couch and within moments were both asleep.</p><p>For the first time in months, Harry slept soundly, undisturbed by dark memories and dreams.</p>\n<hr size="1" noshade="">\n<p style="text-align:center;"><em>I hope you enjoyed this quick glimpse into the healing of a few of our favorite characters.
