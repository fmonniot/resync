Previously, his girlfriend would opt to wear progressively more provocative garments. That small veneer of formality was now gone. The French Veela was as naked as the day she was born; skin glowing with the morning sun like a real-life Aphrodite. Perfectly formed breasts enveloped his arm. She had snagged it in the middle of the night.</p><p>Fleur was extremely clingy at night.</p><p>She never made a sound, always sleeping quietly. Harry himself did not know how much noise he made during the nights, but he was pretty sure he wasn’t the cacophonous car crash that Ron Weasley was. That at least was enough for Harry to not be bothered much by it.</p><p>Clearing the morning haze from his mind, he quickly remembered the other occupant in the room.</p><p>The wizard carefully pried himself away from his girlfriend’s grasp, replacing his form with a pillow. Fleur moaned but otherwise did not complain much.</p><p>Harry watched as Fleur took the pillow between the valley of her breasts. Long legs wrapped themselves around it, and the Gryffindor felt the unrelenting need to go back and take its place. He stilled himself, however. He had another responsibility to get to.</p><p>Luna was just as soundless in her sleep as Fleur was. She looked completely peaceful, at least with what little could be noticed considering a large part of her face was covered by the leather blindfold, yet the witch was still the very image of serenity.</p><p>A small part of Harry was worried that she wasn’t breathing properly. He knew it was foolish. Every precaution had been taken as to not endanger Luna’s life, but that did little to assuage concern.</p><p>The small movements on her chest calmed him, however, and he sighed in relief. If anything were to happen to Luna’s wellbeing, the diagnostic runes inscribed into the leather sack would have alerted him. She was just as calm as the night in her slumber.</p><p>With Luna’s state assured, Harry went over to get dressed for the day. Today would be quite long, it being Valentine’s Day would have been enough with only Fleur, but he had other issues to attend.</p><p>One of which was a getting a special gift he’d ordered for just this occasion.</p><p>The emerald-eyed wizard took a quick bath, then put on a pair of comfortable clothes, and walked out to see Fleur, already waking up.</p><p>The French beauty stretched her arms upward, displaying a pair of glorious breasts before focusing on Harry and giving him a woozy smile.</p><p><em>“Bonjour, mon chéri,”</em> she said before noticing his state of dress. “Already leaving for ze day?”</p><p>“I have to run some errands,” responded Harry. “I imagine we’ll be having breakfast here, but I also must pick up a surprise from my godfather.”</p><p>“A naughty surprise, <em>Maître?” </em>Fleur added saucily.</p><p>“Maybe,” teased Harry before he looked over at their guest. “You’ll need to stay here and look after her while I’m gone.” He looked at her seriously. “I know you’re not very much into being in charge – at least not in private matters – but I need someone to take care of Luna while I’m not here.”</p><p>Fleur nodded dutifully. “Of course, <em>Maître</em> – you can trust in me, <em>non</em>?”</p><p>She stood up and made walked over to the bathroom. That was, until Harry stopped her.</p><p>“Hey beautiful… how about I give you your first present for the day?” asked Harry.</p><p>“You ‘ave somezing for me?” Fleur responded in feigned innocence. “I ‘ope it’s nozzing perverted, <em>mon chéri!”</em></p><p>“Don’t put on anything after you’re done,” Harry whispered, before delivering a light swat to her exposed behind.</p><p>“<em>Oui, Maître.”</em></p><p>Harry’s attention then returned over to the big trunk underneath his bed, the one containing all those presents he had bought for their little games. Most of them were wrapped like presents, thankfully, he remembered their contents.</p><p>He took out two objects, one was packaged, the was not. One was for Fleur; the other would be used on Luna.</p><p>The piece of equipment looked like a ring, with two straps at either side, black in color. It was known as a ring-gag, and if fitted inside a person’s mouth, it would force it open.</p><p>He looked over a Luna, who was now beginning to shift slightly inside her bonds. The smile plastered on her lips told him that she was enjoying it. The girl was more resilient that he had thought. Most girls would either have fled or be struggling wildly by now, not being used to such deprivation of basic movements and senses.</p><p>Harry approached her slowly, taking in every single detail of the bound girl. Maybe with accidental magic the bonds could be undone, but if the person inside was a muggle, or if the witch was deprived of her wand, then it would be impossible to escape the heavy bondage they’d be in.</p><p>It was a risky move to introduce Luna in such a severe manner. Harry had gone to a restless sleep last night, worried that he might have been to harsh.</p><p>The fact that Luna seemed to revel in it was a relief.</p><p><em>‘She must be thirsty,’ </em>Harry thought and immediately eyed the water filled pitcher on the table and filled a cup. Carefully, he then placed himself besides the divan and started to caress Luna’s blonde tresses.</p><p>“Good morning, Harry… or Fleur!” Luna said, lightly moving her head towards the direction of Harry’s fingers.</p><p>Harry chuckled before gently lifting up Luna’s head and pressing the cup to her lips. Slowly, he made sure she drank the water, which the blonde did eagerly.</p><p>“Thank you,” said Luna after she finished the whole cup. Harry set it aside and continued to caress Luna’s blonde hair.</p><p>At times, his hand would wander over to the rich leather enveloping the witch’s body and smiled satisfactorily. The Gryffindor had asked for the highest quality leather, regardless of the cost… the store had been more than willing to supply him with such.</p><p>He grabbed the ring-gag and with pointed his wand at it, watching it decrease in size significantly, until it was safe to be worn of a good period of time without hurting the jaw.</p><p>Gently his fingers moved to the witch’s smiling lips and gently tried to pry them open. Luna responded by timidly sucking at them. Harry guffawed before trying again, this time more forcefully.</p><p>The Ravenclaw finally seemed to understand the order and she opened her mouth slowly. This done, it was a simple matter to maneuver the ring inside her mouth until it rested comfortably inside.</p><p>Luna tested the deceptively strong piece by repeatedly biting it, each time a little stronger, until she finally gave up, and then tried using her tongue to explore it while Harry maneuvered her blonde hair in order to secure the straps behind her neck.</p><p>The silver-eyed witch giggled loudly as she continued to play with her gag, alternating between using her tongue and futilely trying to close her open jaw. It did not open her mouth completely, given the reduced size, but it was definitely enough to make it impossible to close it.</p><p>The struggles soon spread down to her entire body. Luna examined how much she could move, which was reduced to merely a few centimeters if she tried really hard. Before long she gave up, and panted slightly through her open mouth.</p><p>Harry, smirking, continued to pet Luna’s hair softly. He was already getting excited from hearing Luna’s excited mewls. She was trying her best to move her head to the direction of Harry’s fingers, but was now unable to do anything but lay there helplessly.</p><p>It was an intoxicating feeling, having someone under your control in such a manner. It was even more gratifying that Luna – being her first session – already seemed to trust Harry in such a way that she did not protest even for a minute the further addition to her bondage.</p><p>“Thank you, Luna,” Harry whispered to the deafened girl, before continuing to run his fingers along her blonde hair.</p><p>Almost instinctively, Harry’s fingers went from the Luna’s hair over to her open mouth and slowly tried to pry into it. In a sight that reminded him of a lost puppy, she lightly started to lick at his digits while the sounds she made alternating between needy mewls and light giggles.</p><p>The opening of the bathroom door told Harry that Fleur had finished with her morning ablutions. Indeed, turning his head around, he beheld the sight of his girlfriend still drying her hair with a white towel, but was otherwise completely nude as he had ordered.</p><p>Fleur gazed at the dark-haired wizard seductively before her sight was captured by the added restraints that had been secured to their guest.</p><p>“What is zat?” the Veela asked excitedly.</p><p>“One of our toys… I had intended to use it for you first, but… you know – I thought it look great on our little crazy pet.”</p><p>“A ring-gag? What else ‘ave you ‘idden from me, <em>mon chéri?</em>”</p><p>“Well,” Harry smirked before grabbing the package he’d retrieved earlier and handing it over to an intrigued Fleur, “why don’t you open it, love?”</p><p>The French witch tore at the envelope like an overly enthusiastic child at Christmas. All dignity and composure that usually exuded from Fleur was gone as she revealed quickly tried to get at the present hidden within the box.</p><p>A small gasp was the first reaction, followed by a look towards Harry…then to the box again, before she carefully took out the expensive gift within.</p><p>“You didn’t…” Fleur gasped.</p><p>Harry’s laugh resounded across the room. “I sure did. I know how much you wanted one of those.”</p><p>With trembling fingers, Fleur took out two light blue garments – the same color as her Beauxbatons uniform – and looked at them clearly. They seemed to shine, almost reflecting the light around them. It was an odd garment that many people would be quite confused as to their nature yet Fleur held them almost like a priest would a communion chalice.</p><p>“’Arry… zis is…” Fleur tried to find the words, but was too entranced with feeling the rubbery garments in her hands that suspiciously looked like women’s underwear.</p><p>“Happy Valentine’s Day, beautiful.”</p><p>Fleur continued to look at her first pieces of latex clothes. A bra and panties, both of them in her favorite color. Harry grinned the entire time, smugly congratulating himself for his choice in gifts. <em>‘Though, I have to say – she’s not the only one who’s going to enjoy it. Do most guys who give their girlfriends underwear feel the same way?’</em></p><p>“’<em>Maître…</em> zank you… zey are beautiful… I – what I mean to say is – “</p><p>“Try them on,” Harry encouraged. “There should be a bottle of lubricant inside the box that will make it easier. There’s also a manual on how to properly take care of it. The clerk at the store told me that it needs to be washed differently than most clothes.”</p><p><em>“Oui</em>. I already knew zat… still – eet is nice to ‘ave more instructions to clear any doubt,” said Fleur as she dug further inside the box to retrieve a black plastic bottle.</p><p>Harry’s manhood started to ache once again as he stared at Fleur carefully applying some of the clear liquid around upper legs and pelvis, until it took a slippery sheen that made her pale skin glow even brighter upon the morning sun.</p><p>Beaming, she then went on to grab the odd panties and began to pull it through both her legs and then upward like a it was a normal piece of underwear.</p><p>Turns out, that was the first mistake, latex did not stretch like most clothes did. As such, Fleur struggled in order to inch the panties closer and closer slowly, more than likely afraid that she might damage the blue garment. Every time she let go of them, there was a wet slap as the rubber impacted her wet skin, it almost groaned as she slowly and methodically pulled it closer and closer to her flower. The sounds were quite intoxicating when combined with the joyful giggles of the French beauty as she tried her best to put her gift on.</p><p>“Can you ‘elp me wiz ze <em>brassière</em>?” asked Fleur after she was finally satisfied with the position of her panties. With one hand, she held the other half of the set and in her lips, a sultry smirk.</p><p>Harry walked over to her and whispered, “As my lady commands.”</p><p>She then began to put on more of the lube around her breasts, making sure to give a good show to Harry as she spread it obscenely. No place was left uncovered, from the top of her bosom, to the underside, and her pale nipples.</p><p>The bra was a much simpler to put on compared to the panties, yet Fleur asked Harry to help her fasten it behind her back.</p><p>The rubber was strange to feel at first, yet not unpleasant. Harry was quite sure he could get used to touching the stuff very quickly. He would have to after all, considering just how much Fleur seemed to be in love with the stuff.</p><p>The store offered outfits that were way more elaborate – and expensive – than the lingerie. Harry had even bought Fleur a few more surprises. He would have to take her there one day to pick up what she wanted.</p><p>He was confident the Potter fortune could afford such lavish clothes, even if it was Fleur.</p><p>Maybe…</p><p>With a one quiet snap, the ensemble was finally complete, and Harry stepped back in order to behold the sight.</p><p>There was still a slight dullness to the look, a stark contrast to the pictures in some of the ads on the box. Those were far shinier. Fleur however, seemed to know how to fix that.</p><p>Once again, she took the bottle of lubricant (Harry was now beginning to understand why the store clerk recommended buying additional ones) and poured the clear liquid into her hands. She rubbed them around the latex, and it started to take on the characteristic shine the fetish garments were renowned for.</p><p>Fleur looked magnificent in them, an opinion she seemed to agree with considering the way she modeled and posed in front of the full body mirror. The beaming smile seemed to never fall off her lips as she continued to fix any creases that might have formed, or spreading the liquid where any dullness might still be present.</p><p>“How does it feel?” Harry finally asked. “Is it as good as it looks?”</p><p>“Eet’s… tight,” answered Fleur. “But not in a bad way. Almost like it’s constantly ‘ugging me. Eet’s almost as eef ze rubber wants to fight my movements. Eet really digs into you…”</p><p>The latex clad Veela took a few steps, exaggerating the movements on her chest and between her legs, experimenting with the feeling. Every once in a while, Fleur would trace them with her fingers, teasing herself. By the end, she looked a little flustered and was breathing slightly heavier.</p><p>“So… you like it?”</p><p>Fleur twirled like a ballerina with a musical laugh, before finally turning towards Harry. “Like eet? I love eet!” She hugged and kissed the raven-haired wizard. “Zank you so much, <em>mon amour!</em>”</p><p>Harry grinned as his hand lightly groped her generous bum. “I still have so much left to give you… you’ll just have to be… patient until I come back.” He gave a light swat to the latex covered cheek, earning him a playful moan.</p><p>“I can’t wait, <em>Maître</em>.”</p><p>“Good… now!” Harry announced, changing to a serious tone. “I’m going out for a couple of hours – I’ll make sure to get breakfast when I’m done – but until then, I need you to keep an eye on Luna.”</p><p>Fleur seemed unsure of herself, uncomfortable by the request. “’Arry… I don’t know…”</p><p>Harry grabbed her chin softly and their eyes met. “I know you don’t like being in control in private,” Fleur nodded slightly, “but I am sure you will make a good job… you just have to make sure that she’s comfortable with everything. Check the stone by the bed – it’ll show you if anything is wrong. Also, count half an hour and give her a bit of water.”</p><p>The wizard took a deep breath. “Just… you have to – er… you need to find the best way to care for her.”</p><p>Fleur nodded. “Like you take care of me, <em>oui?</em>”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>“Vairy well, ‘Arry… I will give eet a try.”</p><p>“Thank you, beautiful. If you do a good job, I’ll reward you with some more presents,” Harry teased.</p><p>Fleur licked her lips. “I’ll be good, <em>Maître.</em>”</p><p>“Right… also,” he added, smirking, “don’t put any more clothes on… I think I kind of like seeing you in latex.”</p><p>“Believe me, <em>mon</em> <em>cheri</em>, I don’t even <em>want</em> to put anyzing else on.”</p><p>He was sure Fleur would make a good job in taking care of Luna. Even if his girlfriend was not sexually dominant, her kind nature was a good supplement to look after another submissive. The fact that it was another girl would make it easier for both subs to communicate easily – even if one of them was unable to talk.</p><p>With a quick kiss and a farewell pat to Luna’s head, Harry finished putting on his winter clothes and set off to his business.</p><hr><p>It was simple at first to take care of Luna. Given that Fleur needed to pen a delayed letter to Gabrielle, she doubted that there’d by much distraction from the heavily bound Ravenclaw.</p><p>So, the Veela sat down on her table – which she had moved so that’d she’d always have a clear view of Luna while she was busy – promptly grabbed her elegant quill and a piece of parchment, and started to write.</p><p>Fleur hadn’t even finished the first paragraph when she started to fill the effects of her new rubber lingerie.</p><p>She hadn’t been lying when she said that it felt like her sexual areas were being hugged. More than that, it was as if the latex was fighting her every movements. With most clothes, people get used to their presence so that their minds don’t even register as they’re being used in every day life. Not so with this set of underwear, for she noticed it almost constantly, like if Harry’s hands were constantly groping her.</p><p>It didn’t help that, because of its lack of elasticity, the latex panties felt as if they were giving her a constant rubbing of her sacred cavern, digging into her folds incessantly.</p><p>Before she knew it, caressing her breasts and womanhood replaced writing to her little sister in priority. She could almost feel the heat that was being trapped inside the rubber each time her digits passed over her core.</p><p>It became even worse when Luna started to giggle.</p><p>The noises were cute, but became more noticeably arousing as they went on. The rustling of metal and creaking of leather were next, which only increased Fleur’s horniness. She didn’t even notice when she’d stopped paying attention to the letter and concentrated fully on the bound blonde.</p><p>At first, it was only a matter of rubbing herself to satisfy the desire, but the demands to get closer to Luna increased with every single moan. The groanings of her own rubber clothes were soon added to the symphony of pleasure and lust. Almost automatically and uncontrollably, Fleur stood up shakily and walked over to where the black clad figure struggled playfully.</p><p>Unable to restrain her desires anymore, the French witch frantically snatched her wand and aimed it at one of the ornate couches that were part of the improvised living room and immediately levitated it, drawing it closer to herself and setting it down besides the divan where Luna’s leather encased body lay.</p><p>Fleur sat down on the comfortable chair, her eyes never leaving the blonde, who was still breathing calmly in the intense bondage. She positioned herself as best she could while her latex covered crotch seemed to ache with unrelenting need.</p><p>Once she had settled herself as best she could, Fleur’s fingers immediately went over to tend to her womanhood, setting aside the rubber that currently covered it.</p><p>Most clothes that people wore were made out of cloth, wool, or another absorbable material for a reason. It absorbed bodily secretions like sweat and was eventually let to dry out naturally. Latex did not such thing; it retained those same secretions within its confines. So, when Fleur’s fingers dug inside the blue rubber panties, she immediately felt the accumulated wetness of her arousal.</p><p>Fleur was not bothered by it. In fact, it made the situation even more exciting for her as she stared at Luna, digits now tracing her shaved mound unabated.</p><p>With a giggle, Luna them mysteriously fell silent and started to breathe normally, almost as if she had fallen asleep. Being that the blonde was so quiet in her slumber, the rise and fall of her petite chest was the only sign that she was still breathing.</p><p>It looked as if Luna was in a state betwixt waken and dormancy. It reminded Fleur of articles she had read of Muggle monks in the east that could achieve another state of being though pure concentration.</p><p><em>‘Could it have anything to do with being deprived of so many senses at the same time?’</em> Fleur wondered.</p><p>She remembered achieving something similar when Harry had spanked her all those nights ago. That time, she had forgotten about everything and was only concentrated on the pain and pleasure that her boyfriend’s hand was bringing her.</p><p>Fleur was a little embarrassed to say it, but she secretly yearned to be spanked again after that time.</p><p>Nervous, she wanted to see if Luna was still reacting alright. The French witch knew that the stone by her desk was enchanted to let her know if the petite Ravenclaw was in any trouble, but doubt still clouded her mind.</p><p>She was too horny, however, to let her hands leave her pleasure points, and so opted to use other means.</p><p>Gingerly, Fleur laid her bare feet on the leather that covered Luna’s stomach, letting her soft soles feel the rich leather that so thoroughly confined the petite blonde in it’s tight embrace, she never stopped teasing her throbbing core.</p><p>Luna seemed to notice the contact, giggling lightly and attempting to struggle. Attempting being the key word – the birthday girl could barely move a couple of millimeters before the unrelenting grasp of the leather restraints stopped her from moving any further, and returned the silver-eyed witch back to her original position.</p><p>The struggling aroused Fleur even more. She wildly imagines herself in Luna’s place – thoroughly bound and robbed of sight and sound, mouth forced open to accept anything that Harry would decide to introduce inside. Being completely helpless in every single respect as her beloved Maître shoved his formidable manhood into her gagged throat.</p><p>Absorbed in her fantasies, Fleur’s right foot started to wander, dragging itself across the leather and inching ever closer to Luna’s face – what was left of it, at least – until the French witch eventually settled it on top of the blonde’s chin.</p><p>Luna almost immediately reacted to the new stimulus. Being deprived of her senses for such a long time must be finally taking their toll. It started by trying to move her head, but it was hard for her to move her head upward, it seemed to be pretty tiring as well.</p><p>The French witch’s left hand went to her breast, touching the stiffening nipples underneath the light blue latex brassiere as she watched Luna come to terms with the new sensation and using one of the remaining senses she had left and started to sniff through her nose.</p><p>The French Veela raised an eyebrow but grinned mischievously and shuffled her foot closer to the blonde’s nose, observing as Luna continued to inhale in the scent, scrunching her nose but never once opting to breathe in from her mouth.</p><p>Fleur had always made sure to take extreme care of her own body, especially when it came to matters of personal hygiene. Flowery scents where almost a constant with her, something that Harry seemed to be pleased by. But even then, there were areas where it couldn’t be helped, even for Veela. Foot odor was never too strong with her, but it was still present as it was in every person. She took it as a compliment then, that Luna did not seem to be turned off by it.</p><p>Suddenly, her thoughts were broken by a wet sensation on her sole. Instinctively, she pulled her foot away from Luna’s face and back to herself, only to see the blonde’s tongue extended from her open mouth. The Ravenclaw whined slightly once Fleur ripped her foot away, like a child whose toy had been taken away, she struggled once again, and like last time, all movement was restrained absolutely.</p><p>Breathing heavily, Fleur curled her manicured toes, still feeling the wetness from Luna’s tongue. She was surprised that the blonde would actually do such a thing. The French witch had heard of people doing such an activity with feet, but the idea that the innocent looking Ravenclaw would be one of them was definitely a shock.</p><p>\n  <em>‘You’re such a dirty girl, Luna.’</em>\n</p><p>Curiosity and arousal won in the end. Tugging at her breast even harder, Fleur slowly moved her foot back to Luna’s face, placing it once again atop the girl’s ring-gagged mouth. The leather-bound girl squealed excitedly before her tongue once again darted to lick the offered treat, lathering it in warm saliva.</p><p>It was a strange feeling at first, but Fleur would be lying if she said that it didn’t get quite enjoyable after she got used to it. If Luna’s cute moans were any indication, the feeling was mutual. She felt the tongue continue to explore her sole slowly, as if the blonde wanted to savor every single inch. The champion saw the bound girl try to move her restrained neck, attempting to explore more.</p><p><em>‘That’s right Luna… keep going.’</em> Fleur started to move her foot slowly. She noticed that Luna’s breath was getting a little heavier due to the effort she put in moving her body upwards and decided to help the hungry blonde. It was a small price to pay for the pleasurable sensations the Ravenclaw’s delightful little tongue was bringing her.</p><p>Fleur’s fingers returned to rubbing her slit. The delicate motions steadily became more frantic around her core. Her other hand now pinched hard on the hardened nipple</p><p>The other foot soon followed the first, and Luna was no less enthusiastic in her oral ministrations. For want of lustful mischief, she even forced her toes inside Luna’s mouth, engaging in a playful battle with the younger witch’s tongue.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the combined stimuli to finally reach its inevitable conclusion. After just a few minutes of pleasure, Fleur let out an involuntary scream of pleasure as her juices flew out, landing mostly in the hand that she had used to pleasure herself.</p><p>The pale-haired Veela panted, trying her best to regain consciousness after the self-induced orgasm. <em>‘Luna… I have to take care of Luna.’</em> She steadied herself slowly on the comfortable chair, womanhood wet from the climax.</p><p>Fleur examined her hand – which was now almost completely covered in her love juices – and immediately went on to taste her own syrupy essence. She could still feel Luna servicing her feet despite the orgasm. The blonde just seemed to be unrelenting in her hunger for stimulation.</p><p>It was then that Fleur suddenly got a very naughty idea.</p><p>The sliver-haired Veela removed her foot from the blonde’s face and shakily stood up on wobbly legs, still breathing erratically as she wordlessly advanced over to Luna, who’s tongue was raised in the air, more than likely waiting to continue servicing Fleur’s feet. Either that or she was waiting for some more water… the cute moans more than likely meant the former.</p><p>Like she had done with her foot, Fleur first placed her trembling wet hand in front of Luna’s nose and as before, there was no protest from the odd girl, she merely offered her small, pink tongue once again.</p><p>Fleur slowly fed the open mouth her fingers, watching as the tongue gently grazed them at first before retracting back. She figured Luna was trying to give it a taste before digging in completely, much like she had done earlier with the Veela’s feet. It only took a small amount of time before the tongue darted back out, practically begging for more.</p><p>Fleur grinned mischievously before feeding the eager girl practically all of her fingers and watched in fascination as Luna began to lick them without rest, her tongue not resting until every single drop of the French beauty’s essence was completely cleaned out.</p><p>The Veela retracted her hand, satisfied with the impromptu cleaning, yet once again her nether regions began to pulse with need. Slowly but surely, Fleur sensed the wetness beginning to simmer inside the rubber clad panties. Despite the cold outside and her state of dress, the French beauty could not help but sense the overwhelming heat that surrounded her entire body, something that usually only happened when she was in the presence of her beloved <em>Maître.</em></p><p>The excitement once again took over Fleur’s being. She snapped the rubber to the side, exposing her sweltering love box, and then put herself above the leather-bound girl, so that her womanhood was poised directly above Luna’s open mouth.</p><p>Gently, she descended, the excitement was still not overwhelming enough that she forgot about Luna’s state. It did not take long until she felt Luna’s heavenly tongue come into contact with her throbbing pussy.</p><p>There was no hesitation from the blonde this time. As soon as Fleur felt Luna’s tongue, it quickly started to worship the Veela’s folds.</p><p>“<em>Mon Dieu!”</em> gasped Fleur, trying her best to stabilize her body as the blonde continued to provide ceaseless ministrations to the Veela.</p><p>Divine was the only word to describe the feeling. Clearly inexperienced, Luna still made up for in eagerness. During the entire time, she never once stopped stimulating Fleur’s womanhood. The encased girl seemed completely insatiable, Fleur could swear that she felt each and every millimeter of Luna’s excited tongue exploring her sacred flower.</p><p>\n  <em>‘More…’</em>\n</p><p>It did not take long for Fleur to orgasm yet again. Pure pleasure coursed through her very being in and earth-shattering climax. The Veela made sure to lower her wail of pleasure, through the haze of arousal, she had forgotten that she didn’t cast any soundproof charms before giving in to her desires.</p><p>This time, her essence was received almost completely by Luna, who did not seem bothered in the least. In fact, she almost took pleasure in making sure to clean her caretaker’s womanhood completely.</p><p>When Fleur was satisfied, she pulled herself away from Luna’s mouth and covered her mound back with the blue latex panties, satisfied moans leaving her mouth automatically as the rubber went back to tease her satisfied core.</p><p>Once the post-orgasm haze left her, Fleur reached behind her partner’s gag and undid the buckle, followed by both earplugs. She left the blindfold on however.</p><p>“Hello, Fleur. How are you today?” said Luna as if nothing at all had transpired previously.</p><p>“Ah… <em>b-bonjour</em>, Luna,” Fleur greeted, still a little shaken from the orgasm. “Are you alright?”</p><p>“Never better.” The Ravenclaw licked her lips as if trying to savor every last bit of a particularly delicious feast.</p><p>“Are you cold?”</p><p>“Nope! It’s warm and fuzzy in here. Quite comfortable, really.” She wiggled as much she could to emphasize her point. “That was the best night I’ve had in quite some time.”</p><p>“Right… sorry by ze way.” Fleur could almost feel the inquisitive gaze behind the black blindfold. “For… err… forcing you to do zat with my feet and my… um –”</p><p>“Vagina,” Luna stated bluntly, in the innocent way only she could pull off.</p><p>“<em>Oui</em>… sorry for zat.”</p><p>&nbsp;“Oh, believe me – it was a very pleasurable experience. You are quite delicious.”</p><p>Fleur did not know how to think about that compliment.</p><p>“You’d better be careful to not let the Flabbering Fleshticks get to close to you… they’ll eat you whole!” continued Luna.</p><p>“I’ll be sure to be careful,” responded Fleur, still stroking the blonde’s cheek. “I will be putting ze gag back on. Are you comfortable wiz eet?” Luna nodded. “Vairy well. Zat stays on zen… so will ze earplugs.”</p><p>“Please. They are utterly enjoyable.”</p><p>“Anyzing else?”</p><p>“Nope!”</p><p>Fleur grinned before taking the small, black plugs and carefully stuffing them back inside the blonde’s ear canals, blocking all sound.</p><p>Luna remained calm and quiet, so much so that Fleur believed she had fallen asleep. The miniscule struggles that the younger witch had put up earlier were gone now. Perhaps the bound girl was satisfied after having serviced her partner’s lovebox? Could anyone be satisfied by servicing their partner?</p><p>Fleur would need to find out when Harry came back.</p><hr><p>It took longer than Harry had expected for him to return back to Fleur and Luna. He had already planned to go to Hogsmeade first in order to get the more innocent present he’d asked Sirius to get for his girlfriend.</p><p>“Here you go,” said Sirius, the omnipresent smirk was somehow even more evident as he gave his godson a gift-wrapped box.</p><p>“Thanks for the trouble, Padfoot.” Harry took the gift and placed it inside his bag. Considering the weather, he was pretty sure nothing would really happen to the treats that lay inside.</p><p>Sirius blew an impressed whistle. “That’s a mighty gift for just some lady,” he teased, waggling his eyebrows at Harry. “When can I meet this wonderful witch that has my godson buying the most preeminent chocolate in all of Britain?”</p><p>“Never, if you don’t stop pestering me about it,” responded Harry as he took another sip of butterbeer.</p><p>“Oh, come on,” guffawed Sirius. “I need to know if this girl is good enough for my one and only heir, after all.”</p><p>“She’s more than ‘good enough’, Sirius.”</p><p>The Black lord put up his hands defensively. “I know, I know… I just want to meet the girl who’s gotten you in such a good mood lately. You’re improving at a great pace in our training sessions and I don’t doubt that Ms. Delacour is to be thanked for it.”</p><p>Harry raised his eyebrow. “I don’t believe I ever told you that she was my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Oho! It’s ‘girlfriend’ now!? I didn’t know things had gotten so… <em>serious</em>.”</p><p>“Your puns are awful.”</p><p>Sirius chortled a laugh. “It wasn’t hard to figure out – the rumor mill has been wild that Harry Potter has been seduced by a French Veela so gorgeous that she makes even straight witches feel hot below the neck.”</p><p>Harry grumbled as he took yet another sip.</p><p>“Not to mention that Rita Skeeter has been going through story after story about it,” continued Sirius. “I wouldn’t be surprised if at some point Dominique Delacour decided to intervene and file for a defamation lawsuit.”</p><p>Anger started to well inside Harry again – a feeling that he’d been forgetting since he and Fleur got together. That damnable gossip-monger had been a plague ever since the very first they he’d met her. Especially since she’d been making it a point to constantly defame his wonderful girlfriend.</p><p>“One of these days we’re really going to have to deal with that woman,” said Harry.</p><p>“Don’t worry too much about it – it hasn’t affected your relationship with her, has it?”</p><p>Harry smiled. “No… it hasn’t,” he said. “Hell. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t even have remembered her.”</p><p>“Too busy being led away astray by your beautiful girlfriend?” taunted Sirius.</p><p>“Perhaps…”</p><p>“Anyways, I’ve kept you here long enough. Go enjoy the day of love with your girl,” said the hound Animagus before going back to his own drink. Harry hadn’t even left the Three Broomsticks before his godfather was already chatting jovially with two witches at another table.</p><p>The next delay happened when he was walking back to the castle. Through the ice and snow, he managed to spot the hulking form of Hagrid pacing back and forth while holding a crudely packaged gift in his massive hands. When Harry got close enough to greet the half-giant, he noticed that Hagrid was in fact muttering to himself.</p><p>“… made ‘em meself this mornin’. Hope yeh like them… no! Think o’ summat different! Ah –“</p><p>“Good morning Hagrid,” Harry interrupted, trying not to laugh at the sight of such an imposing person bumbling back and forth.</p><p>“Oh… good mornin’ ter yeh, Harry! Wha’ are yeh doin’ this early?”</p><p>Harry showed the gentle giant his neatly packaged present. “Getting something from Sirius… what are you doing, Hagrid?”</p><p>Hagrid looked at his own package like a kid being caught dipping his hand in the cookie jar. “Er… nothin’…jus’ some – err… deliv’ries I have pendin’ since las’ week.”</p><p>“Really… anything to do with new magical creatures?”</p><p>Err… now tha’ I think abou’ it… I do have ter tend to tha’ wounded unicorn tha’ I stumbl’d upon a couple days back.”</p><p>Harry was actually surprised. A unicorn had been wounded? Memories of his first year came flooding back to him when Voldemort’s shade was suckling the silver blood from a murdered unicorn. Firenze the centaur had mentioned that bringing harm upon such a pure creature was one of the lowest moral crimes a witch or wizard could undertake. Only those corrupted with darkness could go ahead and do the evil deed.</p><p>“Who do you think could have done such a thing, Hagrid?”</p><p>“I dunno ter be hones’. It’s strange tha’ someone would want ter harm such a misunderstood creature. If a unicorn has been harmed, then it means dark stuff is involved, be certain of tha’.”</p><p>A feeling of regret started to gnaw at Harry. For some reason he started to think back on Luna – probably being taken care of by Fleur back at their room – and the situation he’d left her in. Bound and speechless with only a small stone being the only way to communicate any discomfort.</p><p>A stone he’d almost threatened her not to use.</p><p>“Have you told Dumbledore about this? He’ll want to know!” he said finally, trying to ignore the feeling of disgust with himself that was slowly brewing insde.</p><p>Hagrid shook his head. “Haven’ been able to see the Headmaster… too busy with them Ministry folk ‘cause of the Tournament… I’ll be cheerin’ fer yer by the way!”</p><p>Harry smiled appreciatively. “Thanks Hagrid. Was anything taken from the unicorn? Was the perpetrator after something?”</p><p>“Didn’ notice anythin’ missin’. Guess he got scared tha’ he’ll get caught. Even poachers won’t go after unicorns… they’ll know better than ter take advantage of one,” said Hagrid while shaking his head.</p><p>“What do you mean?” asked Harry.</p><p>“Unicorns are pure creatures, Harry. So much so tha’ they’ll give other some of their magical features like their hearstrings or hair fer wands… but when they give them, it’s a thing of trust. Takin’ them away or abusin’ a unicorn is a foul deed tha’ will follow you the rest of yer days. Yer have ter be humble and patient with a unicorn.”</p><p>A deep pit started to form within Harry’s stomach. He ignored it at first, trying to justify it, but every second seemed to make him feel worse.</p><p>The Gryffindor briefly compared a unicorn to Luna – a witch who had trusted him so and he had been too rough with her this morning. He’d even threatened and blackmailed her to not use the “safe word”. The blonde seemed to be accepting and even happy with the addition of the gag, but Harry wondered how much that had been influenced by fear of being cut away from both Fleur and himself.</p><p>“I made a mistake… again,” Harry muttered to himself. He’d abused Luna, there was no mistake of it now. She had trusted him, and he’d failed.</p><p>“Wha’ was tha’, Harry?” asked Hagrid, still trying to make the clumsily made package look slightly more presentable.</p><p>“Nothing… by the way,” he thrust a couple of galleons into the half-giant’s massive hand, “Honeydukes is selling some great stuff today… why don’t you go ahead and see if there’s anything you like.”</p><p>“Harry, I can’t accept this –“</p><p>“Gotta go, Hagrid! See you at the second task!”</p><p>The Gryffindor sped up to the castle and went to the kitchens as quickly as his legs allowed him to. The elves were kind enough to give him more than enough for breakfast. They even gave him some chocolate pudding after a special request.</p><p>With the meals in tow, he started to walk over to the stairs. There were a few students that were lazily going down to the Great Hall to catch breakfast. Since it was a Saturday, many students preferred to sleep in.</p><p>Finally, Harry got to the painting of the black knight in front of his room and gave out the password, making sure that nobody was there to listen beforehand. He hurried inside, his heart beating furiously in dread at what had happened to Luna while he was gone.</p><p>“Welcome back, <em>mon chéri</em>!” said Fleur, sitting behind the desk. She had apparently moved it so that she could keep an eye on Luna.</p><p>His girlfriend immediately stood up and went over to him. She was still wearing that set of light blue rubber underwear and nothing else. Harry marveled at how the material seemed to cling to Fleur’s body like a second skin.</p><p>“Hey… brought breakfast.” He laid the contents he’d been carrying on the table, along with the gift-wrapped parcel. “And another present.”</p><p>“You are spoiling me today, <em>Maître.”</em></p><p>“I love spoiling my girl,” said Harry, his finger went down and started to lightly tug on the waistband, stretching carefully, “especially when it makes her looks so sexy.” He let go of the latex, letting it snap back to Fleur’s skin.</p><p>Fleur giggled. “You ‘ave anyzing else for your Fleur today, <em>mon chéri</em>?”</p><p>“Later,” Harry said firmly and took a more serious tone once he looked back at the still bound form of Luna, laying completely still on the divan. It was still an incredible sight, but mixed in with the arousal was a massive wave of regret.</p><p>He walked over to the Luna and quickly undid the ring-gag, setting it aside. The blonde did not say a word, merely tested out closing her jaw. If there was any indication of harm, she did not show it. This was a small relief, but the green-eyed wizard still continued on unabated.</p><p>The blindfold was next. Silver eyes blinked a few times in order to get used to the light, before settling on Harry and Fleur.</p><p>He followed by taking off the earplugs. It was then that Luna finally found her voice.</p><p>“Thank you, Harry,” Luna sighed, her characteristic dreamy smile quickly formed on her face.</p><p>“Hey Luna… are you alright?”</p><p>“I believe that I am doing quite well,” Luna responded in a sing-song voice.</p><p>Harry nodded. “Right… let’s get this off you.” With a wave of his wand the little locks started to undo themselves one after another. Another wave and the little metal contraptions were removed from the straps that secured the sleepsack to the divan and levitated towards a little nearby table.</p><p>“You don’t have to take it off, Harry,” Luna said. “It’s quite comfy in here, all things considered.”</p><p>The green-eyed wizard did not respond, he simply grabbed the petite witch – not that hard considering she weighed even less than Fleur, even with the heavy leather apparatus – and carried her over to the bed like he’d done yesterday. Once she was face down and the restraints were revealed, a spell made sure to release the blonde from the imposing, black device.</p><p>“Did I pass the test?” Luna asked, her protuberant, silver eyes watching him expectantly. She was still nude, seemingly unperturbed upon being seen without clothes.</p><p>“Luna… I’m sorry,” said Harry.</p><p>“Sorry for what?” the blonde asked dreamily.</p><p>Harry looked at the sleepsack – completely slack since its prisoner was now free – and then back to Luna, who was still holding the rune covered stone he’d given her last night.</p><p>“I was an ass to you,” he said, looking into those curious bright eyes of hers. “I should have treated you better… asked you what you wanted to do. Instead, I forced you to do something that I hadn’t even done to Fleur. I even threatened you not to use the stone!” Behind him, he felt Fleur put a consoling hand atop his shoulder.</p><p>Luna looked down at the stone in her hands, then back at him. “I was having fun… but I think I wanted to have fun with the two of you. It was delightful to completely let go of reality for once though.”</p><p>“Even if you enjoyed it, it doesn’t make it right on my part… I abused you, Luna. I thought only about myself and what <em>I </em>wanted. Only right now did I figure out that I never once considered your feelings and wants – I was a complete bastard.”</p><p>“’Arry<em>,”</em> said Fleur, hugging him from behind. “We all make mistakes. Eet is unavoidable, what is important is zat we learn from zem… and to try our best to not repeat zem again. Maybe you made a mistake, but zat does not make you a bad person. Eet just makes you a person.”</p><p>Harry smiled sadly, feeling a little better. His gaze returned back to the quiet witch. “I’m sorry Luna. Fleur and I…” he took hold of Fleur’s arms. “… we’re a pretty new and inexperienced couple – still learning the ropes. If you don’t want to continue with us, that’s fine…”</p><p>“No!” she yelled. “I want to continue with you… I really want to!”</p><p>“Are you sure, Luna?”</p><p>“I’m sure!”</p><p>Harry grabbed her small hand and caressed it. “Very well,” he said. “What do you want to do today then? You get to choose – consider it your reward for being so brave.”</p><p>Luna lips puckered slightly, and she put a finger on her temple – the classical sight of a person deep in thought.”</p><p>“Well,” she finally said. “I really want to see the two of you. Just like you have when you’re having one of your fun times.”</p><p>“I thought you wanted to join?” Harry asked, confused at the request. Then again, this was Luna Lovegood.</p><p>“Daddy always says that observing and listening is the best way to learn,” Luna answered, as if reciting the wisdom of an ancient Greek philosopher.</p><p>“Well… I guess we cannot go against a parent’s wisdom,” said Fleur, who had been mostly silent up until now. So much so that it seemed like Luna had finally taken notice of the older witch and her… unusual attire.</p><p>“That looks amazing!” exclaimed Luna, her wide eyes fascinated with the shiny lingerie.</p><p>“Zank you,” Fleur said while tracing her hands across her breasts. “Eet was a gift from <em>Maître</em>.”</p><p>“Can I have some too?” Luna asked.</p><p><em>‘Why do I feel like the Potter vaults are begging for mercy right now,’</em> Harry thought. “Maybe later. Do you just want to watch or do you want… something else?”</p><p>“Hmm… I want to be tied up!” chirped Luna.</p><p>“Alright then. I wanted to give this spell a try for sometime now. How about you sit down on that chair over there and put your hands in the armrests?”</p><p>Luna did just that, sitting down on one of the comfy looking chairs that was moved for some reason or another, putting her arms of the padded armrests.</p><p>Harry took out his wand and pointed chanted, “<em>Incarcerous!</em>” From the tip, two strands of soft, black rope shot out and aimed directly at Luna’s hands, rapidly binding them to the armrests and tying themselves in a knot.</p><p>When it was finished, Luna tested the strength of the restraints by tugging at them, but they had very little give.</p><p>“Too tight?” asked Harry.</p><p>“Not at all. Just tight enough.”</p><p>Harry nodded. “Very well. Now… before we start. I don’t want this mistake to be repeated again. I need to know what your safewords are.”</p><p>“Safeword?” asked Luna.</p><p>“A word you say when you want to stop what we’re doing if you can’t take it. Just think about the stone I gave you… that kind of thing.”</p><p>“But I don’t want to stop!” Luna exclaimed.</p><p>“Just taking safety precautions. Think of one word that you won’t say by accident.”</p><p>“Hmm… I know! Quibbler!” the Ravenclaw finally said.</p><p>“That’s… quite a word. Most people just go for a color,” said Harry.</p><p>Luna smiled. “Quibbler is Daddy’s magazine, and it always makes me feel happy and safe when I read it.”</p><p>It made sense. Coming from Luna Lovegood, at least.</p><p>“What about you, beautiful?” asked Harry, turning his gaze over to Fleur.</p><p>“<em>Froid,</em>” she said simply. Harry was about to ask further before she said. “We Veela are creatures of warmth and intimacy, <em>mon chéri</em>.”</p><p>“Alright then… shall we start?”</p><p>Fleur visibly shivered in anticipation. “What do you want to do wiz your Fleur zis night, <em>Maitre</em>?”</p><p>“How about another present?” Harry teased while going over to the large chest that contained their equipment. “How about you kneel down and close your eyes?”</p><p>“<em>Oui</em>!” responded Fleur before doing exactly that. She even put both of her hands behind her head, giving Harry a full view of her body.</p><p>Harry rummaged through the giant, black chest. The sleepsack had taken much of the space available, but there were many, smaller pieces of gear that he’d bought. Excitement was screaming for him to try out some of the stricter objects, but he quickly controlled himself when he remembered about Luna. Deciding himself, he picked out four smaller things and closed the container.</p><p>They were leather cuffs, two for the wrists, and the other two for the ankles. He’d been informed that despite their look, they were quite comfortable to wear thanks to the padding on the inner side.</p><p>“Stand up,” Harry ordered.</p><p>Fleur followed his command, still keeping her hands behind her head while she left her kneeling position and stood upright, eyes firmly closed.</p><p>“Hands,” said Harry, and immediately grabbed one of her arms the moment Fleur obeyed.</p><p>Once the cuff had enveloped her wrist, he closed it with the help of a strap. A small hole in the prong allowed for a lock to be fitted through, preventing the small buckle from being undone by anyone other than the keyholder.</p><p>That or magic – but Fleur never used her wand in their games. She trusted him so.</p><p>The other wrist soon followed the first. Two, wider cuffs were applied to her ankles. The black leather contrasted with her pale skin nicely.</p><p>“Open your eyes, beautiful.”</p><p>Fleur’s sapphire orbs concentrated first on him, and then to her restraints. She smiled at first, before she started to move her wrist, more than likely to test them.</p><p>“Comfy?” he asked.</p><p>“Very.”</p><p>“It’s been a tiring morning… why don’t you go back to bed, sweetheart?” Harry offered.</p><p>“What eef I don’t’ want to go to bed, <em>Maître</em>? Fleur challenged.</p><p>Harry held up the box he’d gotten earlier. “Then you won’t get your present.”</p><p>“Tease.”</p><p>“You know you love it when I tease you.”</p><p>Fleur answered by very slowly and seductively crawling on the bed, making sure to sway her latex clad derriere with ever movement she made, until she turned around and sat in the center.</p><p>Harry took grabbed the leather blindfold he’d used on Luna previously and showed it to Fleur. “You’re gonna have to guess your present for a little longer, beautiful.”</p><p>Fleur made a cute pout. “You are delaying zings, <em>non</em>?”</p><p>“Look at it like a carefully made meal. Too quickly and it’s raw and nasty. Linger too long and it will be burnt and tasteless.”</p><p>“Comparing me to food now, <em>Maitre?</em>” responded Fleur. “’Ow romantic.”</p><p>“Aren’t you the one always complaining about British cuisine?”</p><p>Fleur scoffed haughtily. “Cuisine? I don’t zink ze dirty slop of fat you put inside your mine can be accurately called ‘cuisine’.”</p><p>“Hush now,” said Harry, going over to her and placing the blindfold over her eyes. “If you don’t stop fussing then I will change the breakfast menu from French to British.”</p><p>“I’ll be good,” whimpered Fleur.</p><p>With his girlfriend now blinded, he quickly grabbed a foot and tugged, making her squeal but also positioning her spread-eagle across the bed. Before she did anything else, Harry grabbed his wand and pointed it at the bed.</p><p>“<em>Incarcerous,”</em> chanted Harry, watching as four long strands of rope shot out of the wand and followed his command.</p><p>Around the bed, there were four posts that could be used to drape curtains along the canopy. Each of the rope went to a corresponding wooden post and quickly and efficiently started to bind themselves to them. As soon as they were secured, the thick threads each went for a cuff.</p><p>“Ah!” Fleur started to lightly struggle against the ropes as they started to bind themselves to the D-rings attached to the leather cuffs.&nbsp; Once they had looped around the metal links, they went back to their corresponding posts in order to make a secure knot, leaving the bound Veela unable to move her limbs from their spread positions.</p><p>“Now Fleur… remember that we have an audience,” Harry chided before turning around and giving a small wink to Luna, who was looking at the scene wordlessly, but with visible excitement in those silver eyes.</p><p>“What are you going to do wiz your poor, helpless slave today, <em>Maître</em>?”</p><p>Harry chuckled but didn’t answer. Instead he went over to the water-filled pitcher and poured some in his hands before pointing his wand at it and wordlessly sending the accumulated water in the air and taking a cube shaped form. A freezing spell caused it to solidify into a clear piece of ice. Devilishly, he then showed the result to the sitting form of Luna, who was barely holding back a giggle.</p><p>The Gryffindor slowly walked over to the bed. He put the ice cube down for just a second when he reached Fleur’s left foot and knelt down.</p><p>Slowly, he started to massage it, hearing Fleur moan in appreciation.</p><p>“Mmm… zat’s right, <em>mon chéri… </em>eet feels really good.” She visibly relaxed in her bonds, only curling her red painted toes slowly from time to time, but otherwise started to leave her defenses down.</p><p>Which is exactly what Harry wanted when he pressed the cube of ice directly to the sole of her foot.</p><p>“<em>Eeek!”</em> Fleur, instinctively trying to remove her foot from the unpleasant sensation, only for the rope to lose the little slack it had left and prevent it from being pulled any further. “Eet’s cold!”</p><p>Harry chortled before he started to move the ice upwards, towards her red painted toes. Fleur mouth was letting out a mixture between gasps and mewls, along with some involuntary giggles from the stimulation as her naturally warm body came into contact with the frozen cube. As it was dragged to her ankle, a trail of cold wetness was left to mark its path.</p><p>“Now Fleur… you’re a good girl, aren’t you?” Harry asked, never ceasing to slowly drag the ice through her leg, inching ever closer towards her thigh.</p><p>“<em>Oui</em>… I am your good girl – or your bad girl! Whatever fits ze situati – <em>ahhh…</em>”</p><p>“Good,” Harry semi-whispered. “Cause you’re gonna tell me everything that you did with poor Luna while I was gone… you were a good girl, weren’t you?”</p><p><em>“Oui, Maître – </em>I was a good to Luna.” Harry quickly placed the cube on top of the latex covering Fleur’s womanhood. “<em>Merde! </em>Alright… maybe I was not <em>zat</em> good.”</p><p>“Such language from my good girl… maybe I should put a big gag on your mouth. Merlin knows I bought enough.” He removed the ice and started to drag it slowly towards her stomach. Fleur was visibly shaking. Whether from the cold or excitement, he did not know.</p><p>Maybe it was a little of both.</p><p>“Now, beautiful. You’re gonna tell me – in detail – what you did to Luna while she was under your care.”</p><p>Fleur licked her lips nervously before she started to speak.</p><p>“I was writing a letter for Gabi when – oh, <em>Maitre…</em> she looked so sexy just… laying zere all perfectly bound up and wiz ‘er mouth open. You would ‘ave done ze same, <em>non</em>?”</p><p>“You used her helpless, little mouth, beautiful?”</p><p>“I couldn’t ‘elp eet!”</p><p>Harry slowly dragged his index finger through the wet trail the cold water had left behind, passing lightly across Fleur’s rubber confined lovebox, and eventually reaching the shiny blue bra. Softly, his hand started to fondle the latex covered orb.</p><p>“I know my gorgeous French flower can’t control herself.” Fleur gave a needy whimper. “That’s why I’m here, aren’t I?” Harry said while tenderly poking the French witch’s nipple through the shiny, blue rubber.</p><p>“<em>Oui</em>, <em>mon chéri,” </em>the Veela gasped.</p><p>“What did you make her do?” Harry asked again.</p><p>“I… started to please myself… while I was dragging my feet all over ‘er body,” Fleur stated, before her face turned an even healthier shade of red. “Zen she… licked zem.”</p><p>Confused, he turned around to see Luna making a satisfied smile.</p><p>“I thought it smelled nice. They were smooth and tasty,” she said simply. “It was fun!”</p><p>If it had been anyone else, Harry would have been a little flabbergasted. As it stood, it was a perfectly normal answer from the odd blonde.</p><p>Harry laughed as he dragged his fingernail across the sole of Fleur’s foot, eliciting giggles from the witch.</p><p>“I didn’t know you were into that, beautiful,” he teased.</p><p>Fleur briefly stammered nervously before she could manage to get something coherent out. “Eet felt nice.”</p><p>“Really,” Harry said as he started teasing her toes. “Maybe you should return the favor to our guest, then.” He turned back. “What do you say, Luna?”</p><p>The Ravenclaw giggled as she started to wiggle her silver painted toes. “We can do it another day, Master.”</p><p>“Alright then… what else did you do to poor Luna?” Harry asked, returning his attention to her confined breasts.</p><p>“Mmm…” Fleur moaned. “I… came,” she admitted. “Luna… I let Luna clean me out.”</p><p>The Gryffindor slid his hand inside the latex bra and felt Fleur’s nipple – already hard from the combination of cold and arousal – and pinched it softly. The Veela moaned and whimpered, biting her own lower lip.</p><p>“Such a naughty girl,” Harry whispered, not letting go of the hard nub. “Taking advantage of a pure and helpless girl like Luna.”</p><p>“I’m not pure!” chirped Luna from behind. “I really liked it! It was warm and soft and it tasted very good!”</p><p>Harry let out a muffled laugh. “Looks like I got my hands full with <em>two</em> very naughty witches. What should I do with the both of you?”</p><p>“Give us the cure!” Luna almost begged.</p><p>“Cure?” asked Fleur in a nervous tone.</p><p>“We were very naughty… quite wicked and villainous! We need to be given the cure for the bitch-flu!” said Luna excitedly.</p><p>“I don’t think we can blame this on you, Luna. You didn’t have a choice.” Harry turned towards his blindfolded girlfriend. “Beautiful, on the other hand…”</p><p>“Awww…” Luna complained. “I want my bum to look nice and red too! The other girls always say that I should work on getting better skin complexion.”</p><p>“Your skin is nice and pretty, Luna,” Harry assured before he grabbed the box of chocolates Sirius had been generous to procure for him.</p><p>He tore the envelope slowly, trying to drag out the moment as long as he could. Bound on the bed, he saw Fleur was twitching slightly with anticipation as to what she would be getting. Out of the corner of his eye, he also managed to spot Luna’s discarded underwear, which he proceeded to pick up as well.</p><p>“Open your mouth, beautiful.”</p><p>Fleur slowly did so with some hesitation. Harry left her like that for a full minute, trying to see if she’d do anything against his orders. She did not.</p><p>The raven-haired dominant grabbed the first piece – milk chocolate just to be safe – and slowly presented it to his expectant girlfriend.</p><p>Fleur closed her mouth, and moaned immediately as she did so. She took her time savoring the treat, struggling in her bonds as if trying to tantalize Harry to do more.</p><p>He did just that when he suddenly grasped her latex covered quim, eliciting a sharp and excited gasp of air.</p><p>“Happy Valentine’s Day, love,” he said, while using his thumb to rub the place where the sensitive bundle of nerves lay trapped beneath the latex. The twitches Fleur was making seemed involuntary at this point, much like it had been during their bath together.</p><p>Fleur started to rub her pelvis towards his hand, trying to get more and more stimulation than he was giving her. He knew she desperately wanted to cum by now, but she couldn’t do it out of her own free will. He was the one only one that was able to stimulate her needy slit. He controlled when and how much pleasure she got, and when she was able to cum.</p><p>Harry owned her orgasm.</p><p>He demonstrated that when he removed his hand.</p><p>“P-please… ‘Arry...” Fleur begged.</p><p>“Please what, beautiful?”</p><p>“M-more… p-please give me more!”</p><p>Harry chuckled. “I don’t think so beautiful. You already had two today – without my permission to top it off.”</p><p>“I didn’t know I ‘ad to ask for permission.”</p><p>“You do now,” Harry whispered, his hand now focusing on her breasts.</p><p>Fleur mewled, tugging at her bonds helplessly, trying to get as much pleasure as she could. “Please… I need more, <em>Maître! </em>I… I’ll go crazy!”</p><p>“Shhh…” Harry took another piece of chocolate – a bitter dark one – and offered it to her mouth. She took it happily, but still continued to moan, desperate for some more attention.</p><p>“It’s only morning, love,” Harry said as he caressed her long, silver hair. “Tell you what – if you behave and continue to be a good girl, I’ll reward you tonight. Is that alright, baby?”</p><p>“Al-alright, <em>Maître</em>.” Her voice was shaky and filled with pure, unadulterated desire.</p><p>“Good girl,” he said before bending down and kissing her. “Open your mouth again, beautiful.”</p><p>The witch did so immediately, more than likely expecting another chocolate. She let out a surprised and muffled yell when he shoved Luna’s underwear and pressed his hand on her soft lips.</p><p>“Don’t spit it out,” he ordered, rapidly unknotting his tie and promptly using it as a makeshift gag to hold the Ravenclaws underwear inside.</p><p>“Mmph!” exclaimed Fleur, followed by a rapid flurry of French that he wouldn’t have understood even if he knew the language.</p><p>He raised his wand over to ropes and vanished them. “Don’t touch yourself, beautiful. You’ll be tied and helpless again in just a moment.”</p><p>Sure enough, he summoned two of the padlocks that had been used on Luna’s restraints earlier and secured both of her ankles first, followed by doing the same with the cuffs on her wrists once he managed to maneuver them behind her back.</p><p>“Come beautiful… we still have to give Luna her show,” he said while winking over to said younger witch. She had been silent up until that moment, but the rubbing of her legs showed that she was getting very excited as well.</p><p>Harry helped Fleur stand up on her restrained ankles and watched as she hopped over to where he was guiding her. Their destination happened to be an armless chair that was in front of Luna. Once he sat down, he instantly pulled Fleur on his lap face down until she was bent – a position that he’d used once in the past to administer her first spanking.</p><p>Fleur noticed her position immediately and moaned. She knew what was coming.</p><p>“What do you think, Luna?” he asked the quite blonde. “Should we teach this bad girl some manners?”</p><p>“Oh absolutely!” chirped Luna while bouncing on her seat excitedly.</p><p>Harry summoned the fruity scented bottle he had used previously and then turned his wand towards Luna, vanishing her bonds.</p><p>“Why don’t you help me?” he suggested while motioning to Luna towards them.</p><p>Luna almost skipped over to his side and quickly asked, “What do want me to do, Sir? Or Master? What do you prefer?”</p><p>“We’ll talk about that later,” he said nonchalantly. “As for what I want you to do.” He handed the bottle over to her small hands. “How about you help me by giving Fleur her bad girl lotion.”</p><p>The Veela on his lap huffed at the name and struggled a little futilely. A short swat across her left cheek stopped it and she slumped back down in surrender.</p><p>Luna uncapped the bottle and placed some of it on her palm. The strawberry aroma hit his nose immediately, Fleur too if her relaxed state was any indication.</p><p>“All over her bum, Luna. Make sure you don’t miss a spot.”</p><p>Luna took her time alright, laughing as she made sure to spread the clear liquid all over her bountiful derriere. He, on the other hand, was caressing Fleur’s back reassuringly, periodically passing his fingers through the shiny lingerie.</p><p>“Done!” Luna trilled, still curiously touching Fleur’s latex panties. “As shiny as a Twinkling Tetramite!”</p><p>“What’s a Twinkling Tetramite?”</p><p>“They’re little bugs that live underground and lead lost children back home,” Luna stated matter-of-factly. “Unless you’re a grown wizard, then they’ll just eat you.”</p><p>“Right.” He pointed over to the ground in front of them. “I want you to kneel now, Luna. Enjoy the show.”</p><p>Luna did just that and once she was in place, made her biggest smile yet as she beheld the spectacle.”</p><p>Despite the show, the spanking was very light. Last time he wanted to drive a point in with Fleur, to make her reveal all her desires and to not take shame in any of them. To be completely honest with him and with herself.</p><p>This time, he wanted Fleur to <em>enjoy</em> it. He’d heard of women who took particular pleasure in being spanked, mentally and physically. As such, his administrations were less harsh, and he did not make Fleur count them.</p><p>“Mhmm…” Fleur moaned as the first swat, and her body went rigid, as if expecting the next one to be harsher. It was not. After the fifth time his palm met her bum, she relaxed noticeably, almost slumping bonelessly on his lap.</p><p>Even the sounds coming from her seemed to be tinged with pleasure and satisfaction, rather than pain.</p><p>She did start to struggle again, however, when his hand travelled downward and rubbed her slit. He did not linger there long. Usually grabbing her waistband and tugging on it, before making the rubber snap back.</p><p>Luna went mute once again, simply looking on with a smile that threatened to tear her face apart. Those big, silver eyes never seemed to leave Fleur’s rapidly reddening derriere.</p><p>“Do you like it, Luna?” asked Harry.</p><p>“I do. Do you mind if I touch her?” responded Luna.</p><p>“Of course. Come here…”</p><p>Luna crawled over, her position meant that she was still at the height of his lap. Bowing her head, a little, she was face to face with Fleur’s blindfolded, gagged face. Still, the blonde girl went on to touch away, fascinated at touching the Veela’s soft skin, groping her rubber clad breasts, even running her fingers to the fine leather cuffs.</p><p>Most curiously, she went over to Fleur’s bound ankles and started to run her nails through the soles of the French witch’s feet.</p><p>Almost immediately, Fleur went from being relatively calm to struggling harder than she had done even during her impromptu spanking session. Even the improvised gag did not make her laughs any less musical as she tried to dislodge Luna’s fingers from the unusual torment.</p><p>“You never told me that you were ticklish, honey,” Harry teased, doing his best to keep the silver-haired beauty from falling down. “I guess now I have a new punishment for you.”</p><p>“Nhhh!” Fleur half yelled, half laughed as she continued to do her best to avoid Luna’s excited fingers.</p><p>“That’s enough,” he commanded. Luna did so unquestionably, though not without a cute pout.</p><p>“Oh, pooh,” she said, disappointed.</p><p>Fleur immediately slumped down once again. Breathing heavily through her nose, but otherwise unchanged.</p><p>A couple of swats later – along with the appliance of the medicinal cream – Harry shifted so that Fleur’s reddened bum sat on his lap. The blindfold came off next, and the Veela’s eyes immediately settled on the blonde newcomer. She did not say anything until after he took out her gag and the cotton panties underneath.</p><p>“Luna!” she hissed. “I will get back at you one of zese days!”</p><p>“Please do!” Luna almost begged.</p><p>“Now, now… don’t be mad at Luna, beautiful. She’s just having a little bit of fun. You <em>do </em>owe her.”</p><p>“I guess…”</p><p>“And speaking of owing her. It’s still Valentine’s Day and Luna still hasn’t had her treat.” Harry took his wand out and aimed at one of the bags he’d retrieved from the kitchen earlier. A brief “<em>Accio” </em>was all it took for something that Luna immediately recognized to come out.</p><p>“Pudding!” she exclaimed giddily, eyes now completely focused on the chocolate flavored treat.</p><p>“Oh, dear me,” Harry said dramatically. “It seems I forgot to ask the elves for a spoon.”</p><p>“That <em>is</em> a problem,” Luna said sagely while Fleur rolled her blue eyes.</p><p>“Come here Luna – we’re gonna have to… improvise,” he said while dipping his fingers inside the thick chocolate treat.</p><p>Luna did as she was told and once again opted to crawl over to him, the twin silver orbs fixated on his fingers. Once she was at his side, Harry offered the chocolate covered digits to her mouth, which she wordlessly opened and started to suckle.</p><p>“Happy Valentine’s Day, Luna.”</p><p>While his right hand was occupied with feeding Luna, his left wandered across Fleur’s body, especially her still hungry womanhood, an act that was rewarded with needy mewls and protesting struggles. He’d stimulate her enough to cause arousal, but without any orgasms.</p><p>Once his digits were cleaned completely, he dug once again into the pudding but instead of offering them to Luna, his left hand pulled Fleur’s latex bra to the top, revealing her C-cup breasts, along with hard pale nipples.</p><p>Harry grinned before slathering the pudding all over Fleur’s naked tits, paying special attention to the hard nubs. He took more and more of the tasty treat until the Veela’s previously latex clad bosom looked to be covered now by a chocolate brassiere.</p><p>“Well then, Luna,” he said to the kneeling Ravenclaw, “time for breakfast.”</p><p>Luna almost lunged the moment the order was given, almost assaulting Fleur’s exposed mounds with gusto. She switched between dragging her tongue across the chest, and suckling on a particularly rich area, usually the excited, pale nubs at the center.</p><p>Fleur on the other hand was moaning heavily, heavy breaths returning and throwing her head back at times. They were silenced when Harry inserted the leftover pudding into her mouth, which she proceeded to clean out, her tongue dancing around his fingers to get every single bit. Even after it was completely gone, she continued to suck as if on a daze.</p><p>The same could be said about Luna, who had by this point completely cleaned Fleur’s breasts, leaving only a trail of wet saliva across the pair of womanly mounds. Still she continued to ceaselessly drag her tongue around, and would likely have done so longer if he had not ordered her to stop.</p><p>“Alright, pet,” he said to Luna. “Do you want to feel good?”</p><p>“Of course,” responded Luna, who had gone back to kneeling attentively.</p><p>“Very well, because I think beautiful here still has to repay you for the pleasure you gave her earlier.” He moved his lap, shaking Fleur from her own lust filled stupor. “Isn’t that right, love?”</p><p>“<em>Oui… mon Dieu…” </em>She continued to go on in a sluggish babble of French but kept on nodding her head.</p><p>“Very well. I think Fleur is the one who’s gonna be tasting Dobby’s special pudding now.” Harry grimaced a little. “Merlin – that really didn’t sound right.”</p><p>He waited until the horny Veela regained her bearings before he turned his attention back to Luna.</p><p>“Hands behind your back,” he ordered as he took out some black rope.</p><p>It would probably be easier by this point to use the Binding spell with a flick of his wand, but there was still something wholly enjoyable about the act of taking the rope in his hands and personally tying a girl’s arms until they were completely helpless. Every time he passed the rope around Luna’s wrists was enjoyable, and the art of making a secure rope was exquisite. Even with the advent of magic into their games, sometimes it was best to try his abilities in ropework.</p><p>“On the bed,” he commanded, and Luna followed instantly.</p><p>With two more coils, he tied the Ravenclaw’s ankles to the post of the bed, almost in the same fashion as he’d done with Fleur, but Luna’s hands were secured behind her back.</p><p>Harry snatched the last of the pudding and dipped his fingers into it. As he had done with Fleur, he also began spread it across Luna’s skin.</p><p>Harry did not go for the breasts this time. Instead, he started with Luna’s left foot, slathering the underside and the petite toes, trailing up towards her leg, all the way towards her thigh… and ending on her pink pussy lips.</p><p>Luna gasped silently as he softly applied the last of the coffee colored treat, taking special care to not mess up her soon to be shaved pubic hair that much.</p><p>Once he was done decorating the petite witch, he climbed atop the bad and positions himself behind Luna, making sure to grasp her tightly before calling out to Fleur.</p><p>“Beautiful,” he said to the bound Veela who was now looking at Luna like a delicious meal. “Make her feel good.”</p><p>Fleur grinned before she knelt down and started to lick the pudding off of Luna’s toes. Slowly using her tongue to scrape off every last centimeter.</p><p>Luna started to giggle, twirling her toes either out of reflex or to make the older witch’s task a harder challenge. Given that Fleur did not have the use of her hands, she had to rely only upon the movement of her head.</p><p>Harry continued to hold onto Luna as Fleur inched ever closer upwards, the chocolate path disappearing until only the last bit was left.</p><p>Everyone in the room was breathing heavily, none so more than Luna as her wide, protuberant eyes locked completely with Fleur’s. To Harry, it seemed as if they had both reached an agreement through sight alone, from one submissive witch to another.</p><p>It did not take long for Fleur to attack.</p><p>Luna’s first reaction was to squeal, the involuntary sound leaving her mouth as the sensations seemed to overwhelm her. Fleur apparently took notice, because she slowed down considerably, limiting herself to using only her tongue.</p><p>There was very little pudding left, but everyone knew that it wasn’t the point.</p><p>Harry soon added to the blonde’s stimulation by pinching and tugging her nipples. The increased moaning meant that the sexually inexperienced witch would climax very soon.</p><p>Below them, Fleur continued to swirl her tongue around Luna’s folds, teasing her slowly yet getting more daring each and every time until she was teasing the blonde’s sensitive pearl. Finally, she took the hardened bundle of nerves and started to suck on it, driving the Ravenclaw into a frenzy.</p><p>With a high-pitched wail, Luna came, her juices flying directly at Fleur, who did her best to catch all of it with her mouth.</p><p>As soon as her climax ended, Harry felt Luna crash down into his arms, moaning incoherently about Nargles or something similar, before closing her eyes, absolutely spent.</p><p>Wordlessly, Harry unlocked the padlocks that restrained Fleur’s cuffs together. Another spell untiled Luna’s ropes and threw them off the bed.</p><p>The Gryffindor felt the now unbound Fleur crawling shakily besides him, and immediately started to caress the passed-out blonde.</p><p>“So,” Harry finally said after what felt like an eternity. “What do you think?”</p><p>Fleur looked ponderous for only just a moment, before she traced the pale skin of Luna’s neck with her finger.</p><p>“I zink,” she said with a loving smile, “zat you need to buy anozzer collar.”</p><p>\n  <strong>AN: Late chapter, I know.

I had to rewrite some aspects when it came to the various scenes (another reason why this chapter took so goddamn long).</strong>\n</p><p>\n  <strong>To the people who have favorited/followed this story: I will be doing a thorough revision after this in order to fix all the grammar, punctuation, and other writing mistakes that I’ve been ignoring for so long. Be warned if the alert comes over to you and there’s not a new chapter. I’ll do it all at once to make it easier and less annoying for you guys.</strong>\n</p><p>\n  <strong>Please review and favorite and/or follow if you like the story.
